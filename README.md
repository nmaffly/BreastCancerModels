# Comparing efficacy of different machine learning models to classify cases of breast cancer

## To Replicate
1. Download .ipynb file
2. Upload to notebook or colab
3. Run

## Important Metrics:
- Precision: Tells us the accuracy of positive predictions
  - $\text{true positives} \over \text{true positives} + \text{false positives}$
- Callback: Tells us how well the model identifies positive cases
  - $\text{true positives} \over \text{true positives} + \text{false negatives}$
- F1 Score: A combination of precision and callback, ratio ranging from 0 to 1 (higher is better). Useful to look at when there is an uneven class distribution
  - $2 * {(Precision * Recall) \over (Precision + Recall)}$

- AUC Score:

## Logistic Regression Model

A logistic model is good for categorizing numerical data.

Results from model:
- Precision:
- Callaback:

AUC Score: 0.9980893592004703
